This code provides functions for aligning text based on the specified width and alignment type.

Functions:
- `left_align(words, width)`: Aligns the words to the left within the specified width.
- `right_align(words, width)`: Aligns the words to the right within the specified width.
- `center_align(words, width)`: Aligns the words to the center within the specified width.
- `justify_align(words, width)`: Aligns the words using justified alignment within the specified width.
- `align_text(text, width, alignment)`: Aligns the text based on the specified width and alignment type.

Usage:
1. Call the `align_text()` function with the text, width, and alignment type as parameters to align the text.

Example:
```python
text = "Hi everyone, Iam Karthika Krishna K, I am a student of VCET Puttur. I hope you all are doing fine. Have a great day!!"
width = 20
alignment = "left"
aligned_text = align_text(text, width, alignment)
print(aligned_text)
# Output:
# Hi everyone, Iam
# Karthika Krishna K,
# I am a student of
# VCET Puttur. I hope
# you all are doing
# fine. Have a great
# day!!
